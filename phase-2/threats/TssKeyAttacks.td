__Compromise TSS Keys__
  - Extract private keys through collision attacks
    + Requires an ambiguous encoding scheme to be in use
    + And the hash function used must not properly differentiate between similar input tuples
      - The encoding scheme uses a simple concatenation method with a '$' delimiter
      - Or there is no safeguard against input tuples that only differ by the position of the delimiter
    + The collision vulnerability must not have been patched
      - [X] The existence of a security patch would prevent the exploit
  - Forge signatures or extract private keys due to reduced proof iterations
    + Requires the number of iterations to be significantly reduced
    + And assumes that the attacker can perform enough trials quickly
      - There are insufficient rate-limiting measures on the network
      - Or the proofs do not require a computationally intensive process to generate
    + The TSS must be running the optimized code in a production environment
      - [X] A strong review and audit process might prevent this condition from being true
- Bypass the proof of knowledge in a TSS system with a larger challenge space
  + A condition where the challenge space is increased without rigorous proof of security
  + This might lead to potential side-channel attacks
    - [X] However, an effective side-channel defense mechanism prevents it
  + But only if the challenge is not randomly generated or is somehow predictable
    - Which assumes the random number generator (RNG) is compromised or predictable
- Intercept or manipulate the secret shares during the reshare protocol
  + Old parties must not detect the manipulation of their additive secret sharing
  + An attacker might try to intercept or alter the values
    - [X] Robust encryption and integrity checks on the secret shares prevent this
  + Alternatively, the attacker may attempt to insert a compromised share during the reshare
    - This assumes that the commitments are not properly validated by new parties
      - [X] Proper commitment validation and verification protocols are essential to mitigate this risk
- Exploit potential weaknesses in the generation of new  keys by new parties
  + Although considered less relevant, the generation and verification of new  keys might have vulnerabilities
  + If the new  key generation process is flawed, it could be exploited
    - [X] However, this would be mitigated by the new parties performing robust verifications
  + The attacker needs to manipulate the public key verification process
    - [ ] Assuming the attacker can influence the verification process or the random number generator used
- Exploit the lack of session-specific information to replay and spoof messages
  + Requires the absence of a unique session identifier (SSID) or random nonce in the proof's challenge
  + And the ability to capture and replay valid proofs from past transactions
    - A valid proof must have been generated and transmitted in the past
    - Or the attacker must have the capability to eavesdrop and capture the proofs during transmission
