## Dragons

- State Machine Concept: In Cosmos SDK, understanding how a blockchain's state machine operates is fundamental. However, this concept can be a bit perplexing for newcomers. Misunderstandings or misuse can lead to unexpected errors or vulnerabilities.
- IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) Protocol: IBC allows for communication between different blockchains. However, if not implemented correctly or misunderstood, it can lead to token loss or erroneous transactions.

## Foot guns

- Gas Fees and Gas Mechanics: In Cosmos SDK, it's crucial to properly set up transaction fees and gas calculations. If misconfigured, it can expose the network to abuse or result in users paying exorbitant transaction fees.
- Module Permissions: The modular nature of Cosmos SDK requires proper configuration of access permissions to specific modules. Misconfigurations here could allow malicious actors to exploit these permissions.
- Validator Configuration: Misconfigurations of validator nodes can jeopardize the security of the network. Specifically, not safeguarding validator keys poses a significant risk.
