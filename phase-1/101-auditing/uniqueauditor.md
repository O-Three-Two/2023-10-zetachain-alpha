Auditing ZetaChain presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities that differentiate it from other blockchain platforms.

## Cosmos SDK & Tendermint Integration

ZetaChain's foundation on the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint PBFT consensus engine is notable. While many blockchains utilize these technologies, understanding the intricacies of their integration in ZetaChain's context is crucial. The instant finality feature, for instance, is a departure from blockchains that require multiple confirmations.

## Multi-Role Validators

ZetaChain employs a diversified validator system, comprising Basic Validators, Observers, and TSS signers. This layered approach to validation adds complexity, requiring a deeper understanding of each role's function and potential vulnerabilities.

## External Chain Interactions

The Observer role in ZetaChain, which monitors external chain events, is a unique feature. Evaluating the security implications of these interactions, especially when it comes to cross-chain communications, is essential.

## Distributed Key Mechanism

ZetaChain's approach to holding ECDSA/EdDSA keys across multiple signers, ensuring no single point can act on behalf of the entire chain, is a distinct security feature that requires careful assessment.

## Economic Safety Mechanisms

The platform's use of bonded stakes combined with positive/negative incentives to ensure the economic safety of transactions is a nuanced area that demands a thorough understanding of game theory and economic models.

## Decentralized Nature

While decentralization is a feature of many blockchains, ZetaChain's emphasis on eliminating single points of failure, especially in its TSS Signers, presents a unique challenge in ensuring that decentralization does not compromise security.
