## Zetachain Development 101

### What is unique about Zetachain

Zetachain stands out from other L1's due to the fact that its specifically designed from scratch to effectively support on-chain contracts, facilitating ease of use in a multi-chain environment. Their approach method is heavily centered around decentralization and trustlessness, enabling operation across numerous chains without the reliance on centralized trust.

While the concept of an omni-chain or multi-chain approach isn't new, and others have attempted it through methods like message passing, these solutions often depend on trusted verifiers or other centralized entities. 

In contrast, Zetachain is being built to be as decentralized as possible. A notable difference with conventional layer one blockchains is their tendency to retain users and developers within their own limited ecosystems, usually discouraging external integration.

Contrarily, Zetachain's model is intended to break these boundaries; they not only permit but actively encourage developers to use their platform as a springboard to reach and connect with other chains. Zetachain's goal is to provide a superior experience for both developers and users who navigate the multi-chain landscape, enabling more seamless connectivity and interactions across different blockchain networks.

#### H-h-hold on, whats an Omni-chain? How is that different than bridge/multi chain?

You can think of it like a bridge is an example of a multi chain application? It works **between two** different chains.

On the other hand, Omnichain, means applications and dApps that work across multiple chains **simultaneously**. 

Typically, with multi chain apps, the developer might be deploying the same application to multiple chains or similar application, it's almost like they're copy pasting from one place to the next. It's just a series of connected applications. 

Whereas an omni chain application is designed from the ground up to work across multiple chains. So what happens is you deploy your application logic in one place, and interact with assets across multiple chains. 

This magic happens with **Omnichain Smart Contracts**. They are used to orchestrate assets/data on all chains, including non-smart contract solutions like Bitcoin and Dogecoin, on top of its messaging capabilities.

That's what makes it not only different, but unique compared to pure messaging solutions like LayerZero and Axelar.
