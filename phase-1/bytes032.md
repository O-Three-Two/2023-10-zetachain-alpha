### How is Zetachain different?

Zetachain stands out from other L1's due to the fact that its specifically designed from scratch to effectively support on-chain contracts, facilitating ease of use in a multi-chain environment. Their approach method is heavily centered around decentralization and trustlessness, enabling operation across numerous chains without the reliance on centralized trust.

While the concept of an omni-chain or multi-chain approach isn't new, and others have attempted it through methods like message passing, these solutions often depend on trusted verifiers or other centralized entities. In contrast, Zetachain is being built to be as decentralized as possible. A notable difference with conventional layer one blockchains is their tendency to retain users and developers within their own limited ecosystems, usually discouraging external integration.

Contrarily, Zetachain's model is intended to break these boundaries; they not only permit but actively encourage developers to use their platform as a springboard to reach and connect with other chains. Zetachain's goal is to provide a superior experience for both developers and users who navigate the multi-chain landscape, enabling more seamless connectivity and interactions across different blockchain networks.

### What's the concept of Omni chain and how does it actually differentiate from a bridge/multi chain?

I think a like a bridge is an example of like a multi chain application, right? It works between two different chains. 

Omnichain, kind of means applications and daps that work across multiple chains simultaneously. Typically, with multi chain apps, the developer might be deploying the same application to multiple chains or similar application, it's almost like they're copy pasting from one place to the next. It's just a series of connected applications. 

Whereas an omni chain application is designed from the ground up to work across multiple chains. So you can kind of deploy your application logic in one place, and interact with assets across multiple chains. That's kind of at a very high level, the idea for Omni chain daps.
